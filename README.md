TensorFlow Projects for Image Classification and Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains various deep learning models implemented using TensorFlow to perform image classification and sentiment analysis tasks. The notebooks demonstrate different techniques for training models, including data augmentation, transfer learning, and basic neural networks.

Notebooks:

**Data_Augmentation.ipynb:**
Implements a neural network with data augmentation to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. This network is used to classify images of cats and dogs.

**Happy_or_Sad.ipynb:**
A basic neural network trained to classify happy and sad emoji images, showcasing fundamental classification tasks.

**Transfer_Learning.ipynb:**
Utilizes a pretrained model and freezes the layers to transfer learned features for a new task, distinguishing between horses and humans.
